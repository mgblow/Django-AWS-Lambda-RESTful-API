To create a README markdown (`.md`) file for your Django project, you can provide instructions on how to set up and run the project. Below is a sample README file for your project:

# Django AWS Lambda RESTful API

This is a Django project that demonstrates how to create a RESTful API using Django and deploy it on AWS Lambda. It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing devices.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- Django
- Zappa (for Lambda deployment)
- PostgreSQL (or another compatible database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Django-AWS-Lambda-RESTful-API.git
   cd Django-AWS-Lambda-RESTful-API
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the database settings in `api/settings.py`.

5. Apply database migrations:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser for admin access:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The project should now be running locally. You can access the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and the API at http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/devices/.

## Running Tests

To run the project's tests, use the following command:

```bash
python manage.py test devices.tests
```

## Deployment to AWS Lambda

To deploy this project to AWS Lambda, you can follow the steps below:

### Environment Variables

Ensure you set the necessary environment variables for AWS Lambda deployment, including your database credentials and other project-specific settings.

## Built With

- Django - The web framework used
